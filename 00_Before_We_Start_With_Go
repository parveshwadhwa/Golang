1. GoLang is compiled language like java is between the compiled and interpreted language, like we get a class file first then that file will be executed 
through JVM but here Go tool can run file directly , without any virtual machine (VM).

2. When and where to use Golang ?
  system apps to web apps we can use golang anywhere as it is production ready

3. Is this language object oriented ?
   Yes and No , like we dont have any classes or method over riding or any other feature used in other OOP languages here we have structs as this language is
   designed in such a way what you see on the screen is code u can directly predict what is written in the code for what purpose 

4. Very importantly , we dont need to import packages everytime, Go automatically import these packages if we use any of them
5. To run go file, just type command (go run main.go) 
6. Tu initiate a module , just type command (go mod init [name])
